Best Practices for Using the 3dsmax.ini Configuration in Autodesk 3ds Max
What is the 3dsmax.ini File?

The 3dsmax.ini file is the main configuration file where 3ds Max stores user preferences and settings between sessions
help.autodesk.com
. It resides in the user’s local 3ds Max folder (e.g. under C:\Users\<Name>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\<version>\ENU\ by default) and is a plain text INI file. Nearly all customizable program options – UI layouts, default paths, display preferences, etc. – are recorded here. If this file is deleted or renamed, 3ds Max will automatically generate a fresh default on next launch
help.autodesk.com
. This makes it a common “reset” fix for UI glitches (deleting the INI often resolves unexplained interface issues by letting Max rebuild defaults)
help.autodesk.com
.

Editing 3dsmax.ini: You can tweak startup conditions by opening 3dsmax.ini in a text editor and adjusting values
help.autodesk.com
. Always maintain the existing section structure and syntax – the file is divided into sections (in [square brackets]) containing key=value pairs. It’s wise to back up the original before making changes, since a wrong edit could cause unexpected behavior. If something goes wrong, you can close Max, restore the backup or delete the INI to allow a clean regen. (Max writes a new default file on startup if none exists
help.autodesk.com
.)

Programmatic access: MaxScript provides functions to safely read/write the INI, which is useful for building a “tweaker” tool. For example, getINISetting reads a value, setINISetting writes a value, delINISetting deletes a key, and hasINISetting checks if a key exists
help.autodesk.com
. There is also a cfgMgr (Configuration Manager) struct specifically for 3dsmax.ini operations (e.g. cfgMgr.getKey, cfgMgr.putKey etc.)
help.autodesk.com
. Using these, a MaxScript can enumerate all sections/keys, modify them, and even add new sections or keys. (INI functions are robust – if you set a key in a nonexistent section, it will create the section automatically
help.autodesk.com
.)

Key Sections in 3dsmax.ini

The 3dsmax.ini is organized into numerous sections, each grouping related settings. Major sections include
help.autodesk.com
:

[Directories]: Default folder paths for various file types (e.g. scenes, imports, exports, images, etc.)
help.autodesk.com
. For example, it stores the paths shown in Customize > Configure User Paths. (Max can store up to 1024 bitmap search paths here for external files before running into issues
autodesk.com
.)

[BitmapDirs]: Additional bitmap/textures search paths (similar to [Directories], specifically for texture maps)
help.autodesk.com
.

[Performance]: Settings that control viewport and file I/O performance
help.autodesk.com
. Many “hidden” tweaks for speed or behavior live here (discussed below).

[Renderer]: Rendering defaults such as how alpha channels and background filtering are handled
help.autodesk.com
. For instance, toggles for things like Use Environment Alpha or output alpha behavior reside here.

[RenderPresets]: File paths for render preset files and related settings
help.autodesk.com
. (There is also often a [RenderPresetsMruFiles] tracking recently used preset files.)

[Modstack]: Settings for the Modifier Stack UI – e.g. whether the modifier button stack is visible, its height, and icon display modes
help.autodesk.com
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
.

[CommandPanel]: Controls the command panel behavior, such as how it splits into columns and UI thresholds
help.autodesk.com
. (By default, if the panel is wide enough it shows 2 columns of rollouts – this section has the pixel threshold and min column width values.)

[WindowState]: Records the active graphics driver settings and window state for the viewport system
help.autodesk.com
. This includes which viewport Graphics API/driver is in use (Nitrous DX11, Legacy DX9, OpenGL, etc.) and related device info.

[Material Editor]: Settings for the Material Editor. This can include the UI mode (Slate vs Compact), sample slot options, etc.
help.autodesk.com
. (Related sections like [MtlEditorPosition] store the window coordinates of the compact Material Editor UI
tech-artists.org
.)

[ObjectSnapSettings]: Stores snap toggle states and snap options (from the Snap Settings dialog)
help.autodesk.com
.

[CustomColors], [CustomMenus], [KeyboardFile]: These store the file paths for UI customization files – e.g. the current color theme .clr file, menu layout .mnu file, and keyboard shortcuts .kbd file respectively
help.autodesk.com
. Changing these paths in the INI can redirect Max to a different UI scheme on startup (though usually it’s better to use the UI to load schemes).

[PlugInKeys]: A section that can toggle keyboard shortcuts registered by plugins on/off
help.autodesk.com
. If present, plugin names or IDs can be set to 0 to disable their hotkeys.

[CuiConfiguration]: Stores UI configuration info, such as the current workspace name (LoadedWorkspace) and potentially other UI behavior flags. For example, the active workspace is recorded here (e.g. LoadedWorkspace=Workspace1)
forum.itoosoft.com
, and some newer UI options like button label overflow behavior are set here (PushButtonLabelOverflowBehavior, introduced in 3ds Max 2026)
help.autodesk.com
.

There are many other sections that appear depending on what features you use – for instance, opening certain tools will cause new sections to be added. Recent files might be tracked (either in this INI or in a separate .ini for file history). The INI essentially accumulates your preference changes.

Tip: You generally don’t need to manually edit most of these, as the normal 3ds Max UI writes to them. But for power users, editing the INI can unlock settings not exposed in the UI.

Tweaking Settings for Performance and Behavior

One powerful aspect of 3dsmax.ini is the ability to enable “hidden” or undocumented features by adding specific keys. Here are some proven tweaks and what they do:

Adaptive Navigation: 3ds Max 2015 introduced an “adaptive zoom/pan” behavior that many users disliked. Autodesk added a hidden toggle to disable it. To revert to the classic navigation in 2015, you add AdaptiveNavigation=0 under the [Performance] section
polycount.com
. This turns off the adaptive zoom/pan feature. (By Service Pack 2 of 2015 this key was supported, and it’s no longer needed in later versions once the option was officially exposed or adjusted.)

Faster File Load/Save: By default, Max may store extra metadata in scene files, which can slow down saving/opening especially over networks. Two [Performance] keys often recommended by power-users are:

SaveAuxFilesInFileProperties=0

SaveAssetResolvedFileName=0
Setting these to 0 prevents Max from embedding certain auxiliary file properties (like resolved asset file paths) into the .max file, which can significantly speed up file load/save in many cases
cganimator.com
. The trade-off is that if you rely on that metadata (e.g. for asset tracking in File > File Properties), it won’t be saved – but most users don’t need it, so the performance gain is worth it. (Expert note: As one Autodesk expert noted, if you don’t use the asset metadata, turning this off is perfectly fine; if you do need it, then you might leave it on
facebook.com
.)

Preserve Schematic View Layout: In older versions, the Schematic View (node-based scene graph) wouldn’t remember manual layout tweaks by default, to save file size. You could force it to save layouts by adding PreserveSchematicView=1 to [Performance]
scribd.com
. This causes Max to store the Schematic View node positions in each scene file. The benefit is your custom Schematic arrangements persist, but it can increase file size for large scenes (since layout info for potentially thousands of objects is saved)
scribd.com
. In modern Max, Schematic View is less used (Scene Explorer is favored), but this flag still exists for those who need it.

RAM Player 32-bit Pipeline: If you use the RAM Player on certain systems (historically, SGI machines or specific GPUs) and want to boost playback performance, adding RAMPlayer32Bit=1 under [Performance] will make the RAM Player use a 32-bit color pipeline instead of 24-bit. On systems optimized for 32-bit, users reported up to 3× faster frame rates
scribd.com
. This is a very specialized tweak and mainly of historical interest (modern PCs are all 32-bit color anyway), but it illustrates the kind of hardware-specific toggles found in the INI.

Viewport Driver Selection: The [WindowState] section contains keys that define which graphics driver is used for the viewport. For example, GFXType=Nitrous with GFXDirect3DVersion=11.0 indicates the Nitrous Direct3D 11 driver is active
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
. If Max ever fails to start due to a bad graphics config (“Could not initialize the graphic device” error), editing these entries can help. Best practice: ensure the Direct3D version matches between [WindowState] and [CommandPanel]. For instance, if [WindowState] has GFXDirect3DVersion=11.0, the [CommandPanel] should also list GFXDirect3DVersion=11.0 – otherwise Max gets confused which driver to use
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
. In one case, a mismatch (one section said 9.0, another 11.0) caused startup errors until they were made consistent
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
. Typically, you would not add new keys here, but you might edit these if you need to force-switch drivers (e.g. from DirectX to OpenGL) outside of the GUI. It’s safer, however, to use the 3dsmax.exe -h command-line to pick a driver, which updates the INI for you.

Enabling Legacy Features via INI

As 3ds Max evolves, some older features get replaced by new systems – but often Autodesk leaves “legacy” switches in the INI so power users can re-enable old behavior. A prime example is materials:

Force Old-Style Materials on Import/Export: Since 3ds Max 2021, Autodesk’s FBX/OBJ importers default to using Physical Materials instead of the old Standard materials, and the Scene Converter may auto-promote legacy materials to physical. This can be problematic if your pipeline or other software can’t handle Physical materials
github.com
. The solution: in the [LegacyMaterial] section of 3dsmax.ini, add the following keys (set them to 1) to revert to Standard (legacy) materials for various import/export operations
github.com
:

StandardMtlFBXImport=1 – Import FBX with Standard materials instead of Physical
github.com
. (By default this is 0 in recent Max releases, meaning FBX imports convert materials to Physical. Setting it to 1 preserves them as Standard.) Users confirmed that switching this fixes issues like missing textures on FBX import
forums.autodesk.com
.

OBJImport=1 – Use Standard Mtl on OBJ import
github.com
.

3DSImport=1 – Use Standard Mtl on .3DS import (relevant for very old format)
github.com
.

ATFImporter=1 – Use Standard Mtl for ATF imports (ATF covers formats like Revit, STEP, etc.)
github.com
.

SceneConverter=1 – This prevents the scene converter from automatically replacing Standard materials (and lights) with Physical equivalents when opening older scenes
github.com
. Essentially, it keeps “legacy” materials intact unless you manually run a conversion.

Together, these [LegacyMaterial] toggles ensure that legacy materials stay as-is, unless you choose otherwise. They are not exposed in the UI; you must add them to the INI. (All were introduced around Max 2021 when PhysicalMaterial became the default; they continue to work in 2022–2025 and presumably until Autodesk removes Standard materials entirely in the future.)

Legacy Material Export: Likewise, in the [ExportPhysicalMaterial] section, you can add PhysicalMtlAsLambert=1
github.com
. This tells Max, when exporting to formats that don’t support PhysicalMaterials, to downgrade Physical materials to a basic Lambertian material (or equivalent) instead of attempting to bake them. For example, if exporting to an older engine or format, this can ensure compatibility by not using unsupported material features. If this key is 0 (or absent), exports might try to convert Physical materials in ways that could be problematic in the target application. Setting it to 1 makes the export treat them as simple Lambert shading.

Rendering Alpha for Additive Opacity: A more specialized toggle: Additive transparency (where multiple overlapping transparent surfaces intensify brightness) normally doesn’t output to the alpha channel the same way standard opacity does. In recent versions, Autodesk changed how additive materials contribute to alpha. If you prefer the “old” behavior, you can set AlphaOutOnAdditive=0 in the INI (likely under [Renderer] or [Materials])
help.autodesk.com
. In 3ds Max 2024+, the default might have flipped to 1 (including additive in alpha); setting 0 reverts to legacy behavior where additive opacity doesn’t add to the alpha channel
help.autodesk.com
. This is an example of a rendering-related hidden setting that can be added for fine control.

Gamma Settings: 3ds Max’s gamma/LUT preferences (for linear workflow) are stored in the INI under [Gamma]. This section includes keys for display gamma and file input/output gamma. For example, you might see:

[Gamma]  
DisplayGamma=2.2  
BitmapInputGamma=2.2  
BitmapOutputGamma=2.2  


(Exact key names can vary by version: some older versions used FileInGamma/FileOutGamma.) If you need to enforce a certain gamma on all scenes, editing these values or propagating this section to multiple machines can do it. However, Max also exposes these in Preferences UI, and in modern versions, color management is shifting to OCIO, so the [Gamma] section may eventually become less relevant. It’s still useful to know it exists – for instance, if you had a render node with wrong gamma, you could update its 3dsmax.ini to match your 2.2 workflow.

UI and Workflow Customizations via INI

Many UI behaviors can be fine-tuned in 3dsmax.ini – some directly, others by writing new keys:

Command Panel Column Threshold: In [CommandPanel], the keys RollupBreakThreshold and MinimalColumnWidth control when the command panel splits into two columns
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
. By default, RollupBreakThreshold=50 (a percentage of the UI width, or another unit) and MinimalColumnWidth=0. Essentially, if the command panel is wider than a certain threshold, Max shows two side-by-side columns of rollouts. You could increase the threshold to force a single column even on a wide screen, or set it lower to split into two columns more readily. Note: The exact mechanics (pixel vs percent) aren’t documented, but power users sometimes tweak this for personal UI layouts.

Modifier Stack display: The [Modstack] section can be adjusted. e.g. ShowAllSets=0 means the Modifier stack will only show the currently active modifier set’s buttons rather than all sets
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
. In older versions there was also ShowAllIcons (to show all modifier icons at once) – in newer versions, that may have been consolidated into sets. You can also find ModStackHeight=<pixels> which is the height of the visible modifier list area
shop.blogchiasekienthuc.com
. If you want a taller or shorter modifier panel by default, you could change this number (though it’s usually set automatically by dragging the UI). Visible=1 simply indicates the mod stack panel is open; if set to 0, the stack might be collapsed/hidden – typically you wouldn’t change that manually.

Material Editor UI: There are a couple of things stored here:

The [Material Editor] section might contain a flag for which mode is active (Slate vs Compact). For instance, if you switch to the Slate Material Editor, Max might record that choice so it opens in Slate next time.

The Material Editor window size/position for the Compact editor is stored under [MtlEditorPosition]. Within this, keys like MainWindow=xpos ypos width height define the last position and dimensions
tech-artists.org
. Notably, width (x-size) of the compact editor is not directly user-resizable (it’s somewhat fixed by design), and editing it in the INI tends to be overridden by Max at startup
tech-artists.org
. So while you can see different values on different PCs (as noted by users in a multi-monitor setup), manually setting it may not stick. This is one example of a parameter that Max will auto-correct if changed – essentially some UI layout values get recomputed on launch, so editing them has limited effect.

In 3ds Max 2026, a new [Materials] section was introduced. It includes options like ShowMultiMaterialPreviews and ShowMaterialSwitcherPreviews (boolean flags) which let you toggle preview thumbnails for multi/sub-object materials and for the Material Switcher nodes
facebook.com
. By default, Max 2026.2 shows small previews in those UI elements; if someone found that distracting, they could set those to 0 via the INI. This is a good example of Autodesk adding an .ini-controlled feature as a result of user feedback, even if not exposed in the main UI.

Workspace and UI Scheme: If you want to standardize the UI across multiple machines, you can use [CuiConfiguration] and related sections. For instance, LoadedWorkspace in [CuiConfiguration] sets which workspace is active
forum.itoosoft.com
 – if you have a custom workspace (window arrangement, etc.), you can deploy an INI with that name set so Max loads it by default. You can also point the INI to custom UI files: e.g. if you have a shared toolbar layout .mnu, set the [CustomMenus] path to that file; same for [CustomColors] and [KeyboardFile] for color scheme and hotkeys. When Max starts, it will load those instead of the defaults.

UI Button Text Overflow: A recent customization (Max 2026) is the ability to control how long path names appear on buttons (for instance in the Material Editor or Render Setup, where long file paths might be truncated or overflow). The PushButtonLabelOverflowBehavior key under [CuiConfiguration] controls this
help.autodesk.com
. It’s not in older INIs, but you can add it in 2026 to change overflow alignment or truncation behavior for UI buttons. Autodesk documents such keys in release notes or help when they add them – it’s worth scanning “What’s New” docs for mentions of new INI options each release.

Guidelines: What You Can and Can’t Do

The possibilities of 3dsmax.ini are vast – almost every adjustable setting in Max is or has been stored here. This makes it a goldmine for customization, but also requires care:

Adding New Keys: You can add any of the known tweak keys (as discussed above) to unlock functionality. If the key is recognized by 3ds Max, it will take effect. For example, adding AdaptiveNavigation=0 or StandardMtlFBXImport=1 works because Max’s code checks for those entries on startup
polycount.com
github.com
. Always put the new key under the correct [section]; if the section doesn’t exist, you can create it at the end of the file. Max will merge it when reading. (Max is quite tolerant: if you use the MaxScript functions to set a key, it will create the section automatically if needed
help.autodesk.com
.)

Unsupported Keys: If you invent a random key, 3ds Max will simply ignore it. The program only reacts to keys it is programmed to look for. So adding things that aren’t documented or discussed in forums is trial-and-error – you might get lucky if a dev left an Easter egg, but generally stick to known keys. The good news is that leaving an unrecognized key doesn’t usually harm anything (Max will skip it). But some settings are read but no longer used – for example, older versions had [Geometry] or other sections for features that have since changed; adding those in a new version likely does nothing. In short, unused keys = no effect.

Removed or Deprecated Settings: Autodesk occasionally retires features, but the INI keys might linger. For instance, the AdaptiveNavigation toggle became irrelevant after 2016 (when the navigation mode was fixed/improved). If you carry your INI from 2015 into 2024, that key will still sit there, but it doesn’t do anything in 2024. It doesn’t hurt either – Max will ignore obsolete keys. Another example: if Standard materials eventually get fully removed from 3ds Max, the [LegacyMaterial] toggles might no longer have any effect in that future version (though they won’t cause an error). Therefore, when supporting multiple versions via one script, you may need to know which keys apply to which versions. Checking official documentation or update logs can clarify this. Community forums are a great resource – whenever a new version comes out, users often post discoveries of new .ini settings or note that certain old ones no longer work.

Do Not Edit vs. Safe to Edit: Some parts of 3dsmax.ini are purely informational or managed by Max and not meant for manual tweaking. For example, entries like ActiveViewport=... or UI element positions can be reset by Max at startup. Editing those is usually “safe” but pointless. On the other hand, entries that correspond to user-facing preferences (even if hidden) are fair game to tweak. It’s generally not recommended to edit [WindowState] driver entries unless absolutely necessary – using Max’s own driver setup is safer. But something like [Performance] or [Materials] sections are intended for user customization (they exist specifically to allow opting in/out of certain behaviors).

Maintain Syntax: Ensure you don’t accidentally remove brackets or duplicate a section name. The file should have unique section names. If you duplicate a section, Max might only read the first occurrence. Also, keys are usually read case-insensitively (e.g. AdaptiveNavigation vs adaptivenavigation doesn’t matter), but it’s good practice to follow the exact casing as in docs/forums.

When in doubt, test: The best way to see if an .ini tweak works is to add it, save the file, then start 3ds Max and verify the behavior. If it doesn’t do what you expected, it might be an unsupported or wrong key for that version. Also remember that some changes (especially those affecting startup, like driver selection or default gamma) require a restart of 3ds Max to take effect.

In summary, the 3dsmax.ini file is a powerful tool for customizing Autodesk 3ds Max. It contains a huge array of settings – from simple UI preferences to hidden switches that enable legacy workflows or performance boosts. By understanding what each section and key controls, you can create presets and scripts (a “tweaker” UI) that expose these options for easy toggling. Autodesk’s official documentation provides a basic outline of sections
help.autodesk.com
, and their community forums plus user blogs are rich sources of specific tweaks and best practices. Always keep backups and note which version each tweak applies to, and you’ll be able to safely harness the full potential of 3dsmax.ini for a faster, more tailored 3ds Max experience.
