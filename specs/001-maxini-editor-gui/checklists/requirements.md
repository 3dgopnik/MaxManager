# Specification Quality Checklist: MaxINI Editor GUI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**GitHub Issue**: [#10](https://github.com/3dgopnik/MaxManager/issues/10)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
  - ✅ No mention of specific frameworks except in Dependencies (allowed)
  - ✅ Technology-agnostic functional requirements

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ All user stories explain value and priority
  - ✅ Success criteria measure user outcomes
  - ✅ Requirements driven by user scenarios

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Clear, plain language descriptions
  - ✅ Technical terms explained in context
  - ✅ No code or implementation jargon

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios & Testing (with 4 prioritized stories)
  - ✅ Requirements (20 functional requirements)
  - ✅ Success Criteria (8 measurable outcomes)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ All requirements are fully specified
  - ✅ Reasonable assumptions documented in Assumptions section

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ Each FR has clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ Specific measurable outcomes defined
  - ✅ No vague terms like "should", "might", "possibly"

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ SC-001: < 5 minutes for editing (vs 15+ manual)
  - ✅ SC-002: 0 cases of file corruption
  - ✅ SC-003: < 30 seconds preset application
  - ✅ SC-004: 90% success rate first attempt
  - ✅ SC-005: 70% time reduction
  - ✅ SC-006: < 2 sec for 5MB files
  - ✅ SC-007: 100% tooltips translated
  - ✅ SC-008: < 1 minute backup restoration

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - ✅ No mention of implementation details
  - ✅ Focused on user-observable outcomes
  - ✅ Measurable without knowing tech stack

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ User Story 1: 4 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 2: 4 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 3: 4 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 4: 3 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ All in Given-When-Then format

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ 7 edge cases documented
  - ✅ Missing file, corrupted file, locked file, multiple versions
  - ✅ Large files, permission issues, obsolete parameters

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines exclusions
  - ✅ Auto-optimization, cloud sync, AI recommendations excluded
  - ✅ Only max.ini editing, not other config files

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ 6 assumptions documented (install paths, permissions, formats)
  - ✅ 5 dependencies listed (PySide6, configparser, winreg, etc)
  - ✅ All reasonable and achievable

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ FR-001 to FR-020: all testable and specific
  - ✅ Each requirement uses MUST/SHOULD consistently
  - ✅ No ambiguous requirements

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ P1 (Edit): Core functionality - MVP
  - ✅ P2 (Presets): Key value proposition
  - ✅ P3 (Custom presets): Extended functionality
  - ✅ P4 (i18n): UX enhancement
  - ✅ Each story independently testable

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ Time savings: 5 min vs 15 min editing, 30 sec vs 30 min presets
  - ✅ Reliability: 0 corruption cases
  - ✅ Usability: 90% first-attempt success
  - ✅ Performance: 70% time reduction overall

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Dependencies section is appropriately technical (allowed)
  - ✅ Requirements focus on capabilities, not implementation
  - ✅ No class names, function names, or code structure mentioned

## Specification Quality Score

**OVERALL STATUS**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is ready for planning

**Score**: 32/32 checks passed (100%)

## Validation Summary

### Strengths
1. ✅ **Excellent prioritization**: User stories properly prioritized (P1-P4) with clear independent testing criteria
2. ✅ **Comprehensive edge cases**: 7 edge cases covering all major failure scenarios
3. ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 8 criteria have specific quantitative metrics
4. ✅ **Complete functional requirements**: 20 FRs covering all aspects of functionality
5. ✅ **Clear scope boundaries**: Out of Scope section prevents feature creep

### Ready for Next Phase

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for `/MaxManager.plan`**

No clarifications needed. All requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous.

## Notes

- Specification reviewed against all quality criteria
- All mandatory sections completed with high quality content
- No implementation details in requirements (only in Dependencies, which is appropriate)
- User stories follow independent testability pattern correctly
- Success criteria are all measurable and technology-agnostic
- Ready to proceed to implementation planning phase

**Recommendation**: Proceed with `/MaxManager.plan` to create implementation plan for this feature.
