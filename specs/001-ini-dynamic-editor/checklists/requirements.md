# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic INI Editor with Real-time Editing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Details**:
- All mandatory sections completed with concrete details
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent test scenarios
- 15 functional requirements, all testable and unambiguous
- 4 key entities clearly defined
- 8 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 5 edge cases identified with clear handling expectations
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all aspects have reasonable defaults

**Assumptions Made**:
1. 3dsMax.ini location follows standard installation path pattern
2. UTF-16 LE encoding is standard for 3ds Max INI files (confirmed from existing parser)
3. Backup strategy: timestamp-based .bak files (industry standard)
4. Visual indicators use yellow (modified) and green (saved) colors (common UX pattern)
5. Horizontal scroll navigation with arrows when >10 tabs (standard UI pattern)
6. Inline editing via double-click (standard interaction pattern)

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ Yes - specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Specification leverages existing MaxINIParser module for file operations
- UI design aligns with existing ModernSidebar and ModernHeader components
- All validation items passed on first iteration
- No clarifications needed from user - specification is actionable as written
